## adlist

This is a quite simple utility for managing `NXDOMAIN` static DNS records driven by RouterOS.
You will be able to specify as many `hosts` files you have and get a unified bundle as a `.rsc` script.

I've added a `submodule` [which contains a curated list](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) of `hosts`, in case if you don't have any.

See `mkadlist.sh` for more and change it as you wish.
